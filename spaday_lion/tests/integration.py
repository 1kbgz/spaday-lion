"""A spaday page on spaday-lion, shared with a downstream library through the import map.

The integration this exercises end to end:

* the generated catalog authored in Python and wired with spaday's own state -- two ``LionButton``\\ s
  drive a store field that an output reads;
* a downstream library that imports Lion by its bare specifiers, left as imports in its bundle,
  which the page's import map resolves to spaday-lion's copy, so nothing registers the same tags
  twice. It has no Python of its own beyond a schema-carrying :class:`~spaday.Component` and a
  :class:`~spaday.ComponentPackage` serving its bundle.

Served for the browser tests; ``/conformance.js`` hands back the check that the package's own
bundle implements the catalog generated for it.
